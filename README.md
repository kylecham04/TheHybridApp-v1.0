The Hybrid App 
-The Hybrid App is a Java application that allows users to create accounts and track their max lifts, daily lifts, and runs.

What is the Hybrid App? 
-The Hybrid App is a Java application that integrates Swing UI to enhance the user experience. It connects to a MySQL database that currently supports three different tables.

-The app was created to track not only my own lifts but also those of my parents and friends, keeping us motivated on our fitness journey this summer. It provides everything that paid apps offer, with nothing locked behind a paywall.

What Functions Does the Hybrid App Have? 
-In the Hybrid App, you can create a unique account that is permanently saved in the MySQL database until the account is deleted. With this account, you can sign in, add your max lifts, log daily lifts and runs, track your progress compared to others, and explore many more features. :-)

How Do I Run the Hybrid App? 
-To run the Hybrid App, you need to have a JDK installed and an IDE ready to use, preferably IntelliJ but VS Code also works. Download the source files and create a new project with them in your IDE to have the project at your fingertips.

-Additionally, you will need to download and import a JDBC jar file (Java Database Connector). You can find videos on YouTube on how to do this, as well as how to download the JDK and set up the IDE.

What's to Come? 
-I am currently working on an efficient way to suggest users workouts for the day, which will be completely free and enhance the user experience.

-I plan to upgrade the user interface and experience, making it cleaner and more appealing. Finally, or perhaps the first thing I'll actually do, is add JUnit tests to all methods to ensure there are no bugs in the program.

Feel free to check out the project and contribute!
